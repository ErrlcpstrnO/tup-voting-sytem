Account Terms</h2><p><strong>Short version:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</em></p><h3>1. Account Controls</h3><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</p><h3>2. Required Information</h3><p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#k-payment" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">paid Account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p><h3>3. Account Requirements</h3><p>We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.</p><ul><li><p>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:</p></li><li><p>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.</p></li><li><p>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</p></li><li><p>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#l-cancellation-and-termination" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">terminate that User’s Account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</p></li><li><p>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.</p></li><li><p>You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Specially Designated National (SDN)</a>&nbsp;or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/articles/github-and-export-controls" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Export Controls policy</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>4. Account Security</h3><p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.</p><ul><li><p>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).</p></li><li><p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p></li><li><p>You will promptly&nbsp;<a href="https://support.github.com/contact?tags=docs-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">notify GitHub</a>&nbsp;if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</p></li></ul><h3>5. Additional Terms</h3><p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p><p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p><p>If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/articles/github-enterprise-cloud-addendum" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Enterprise Cloud Addendum</a>&nbsp;applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>`,
